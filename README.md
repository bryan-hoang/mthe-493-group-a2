> Optimization of Data Allocation with Training Time Constraints in Heterogeneous Edge Learning

Main repo for MTHE 493 Group A2's documentation and source code. An implementation of a distributed edge learning algorithm that optimizes how data is allocated to workers.

## Getting started

Note: The project dependencies target an environment that is a 32-bit ARM architecture (e.g., a raspberrypi) with python 3.9.

To install necessary project dependencies, run

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bryan-hoang/mthe-493-group-a2.git
cd mthe-493-group-a2
make install
```

on each machine to be used to install the python dependencies using `pipenv` and to ensure proper libraries are installed for `pytorch` to work.

**Access the `pipenv` virtual environment using `pipenv shell` or `pipenv run <command>`**. Then to set up the system,

1. Start the notice board by running

   ```sh
   python src/notice_board.py
   ```

   on a machine on the network.

1. Start the workers by running

   ```sh
   python src/worker.py
   ```

   on each machine that you would like to use as a worker.

1. Configure the client's parameters by running

   ```sh
   dotenv set BETA <value>
   dotenv set S_MIN <value>
   ```

   on the machine you would like to act as the orchestrator. See [Configuration](#configuration) for more details.

1. Start the client by running

   ```sh
   python src/client.py
   ```

   on the machine you would like to act as the orchestrator.

## Developing

### Built With

- [axon-ecrg](https://github.com/DuncanMays/axon-ECRG)
- [pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)

### Prerequisites

- `python 3.9`

### Setting up Dev

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bryan-hoang/mthe-493-group-a2.git
cd mthe-493-group-a2
make install-dev
```

The `install-dev` recipe installs additional useful development experience packages list in the project's [Pipfile](Pipfile).

### Deploying / Publishing

<!-- TODO(bryan-hoang): Not sure if/how we're planning on improving this part of the orkflow. -->

give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Configuration

The project uses [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#python-dotenv) to load environment variables from a `.env` file the [src/client.py](src/client.py) reads from to retrieve the `BETA` and `S_MIN` parameters.

The package has a [CLI command-line interface](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#command-line-interface) to make settings the values in the `.env` file easier.

## Tests

The project is set up to use [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest#readme) to detect and run all test files. `make test` is a recipe that will run the tests naively under the [src/tests](src/tests) folder.

```shell
make test
```
